## Pitch

The education of children is critical to the future success of our children, and as we all know, our children are our future. With the recent pandemic we have seen a great deal of disruption, and schools have not escaped unscathed. In Arizona alone, there is a shortage of _ teachers. Desperate to meet the needs of our students, the Arizona department of education has begun  a new program that allows University students to compleate their college education through hands on teaching in classrooms with real students. 

Our sponsor Christopher Aungst who is the director of professional education at NAU's College of Education is tasked with ensuring his students are elligable and on track to participate in this **Student Teacher Intern** program. This program is an increadible opportunity to better serve Arizona students as well as give student teachers a head start in their career.

## Questions

Q: How  does it impede our client?

A: Currently they spend ___ (500hours) of time manually orginizing who is ellegable, and then more time tracking their status. the **administrative overhead** is increadible

Q: What do we envision to build them?

A: A consilidated system that allows for automatic determination of eligibility, and a way to track and update requirement status, as well as a place to store associated documentation. It will act as a **single source of truth**. We should expand on this to include more information on the fact that this **single source of truth** could be expanded to offer more services to the UNiversity staff and their students alike.

## Section 3.
- As you work your way down from big picture, to how the exact work/business your client connects in within this story, you'll want to introduce your client. Say who it is, (name, company, and any relevant personal background. A headshot and a logo is nice) and connent them into the big picture discussion you just start. For example, if your client makes cloud computing infrastructure software, you will have started by painting a big picture where you talked about the huge growth and impact of cloud computing. After you've established this broad picture, you might narrow things to your client with: "Our client's company is generally in the business of providing cloud asset management services". After you've introduced what the client does overall, a concrete example is often a good way to explain this and make it real for the audience, e.g., "For example, suppose you are a small company selling widgets and you want to cloud-host your online store, but are stymied by the complexity of cloud services. You could contract our client to..." and so on. Plus, as a nice bonus: you can come back to and continue with that example in the next steps!

## Section 4. "How the business works"
- Now that we know what your client's business is, we need to know more about *how that business works*". A great tool for this is giving and information/workflow view of the client's business process. A flow diagram is great here, and you can then just walk through it verbally step-by-step, explaining the client's work process. If you intro'd a concrete example before, you could re-use it here, showing how the work process accomplishes the example task. This is critical to understand because next you're going to...

- we could talk about the use of excell spreadsheets, how data gets lost, how they have to manage signatures between multiple people

## Section 5.
- ...explain what is broken/wrong/deficient...what is it that made your client wish for some new/better software? Because you've clearly explained the work process, you can simply point to the part in it that is slow/broken/efficient. Give a general verbal explanation of the problem, then get specific: bullet out a few specific weaknesses/limitations of the current system that are the root motivation for your project.

## Section 6.
- Now intro your solution. Describe the solution in broad outline, e.g., "At this early stage of our understanding, we envision solving this problem with a sophisticated WebApp that handles the <whatever for the client>. In this app, users could log in securely, then do <x y and z>". Again, follow that overall intro through with your concrete example. If you do this right, it will be obvious to the whole room that your solution very clearly does brilliantly solve the problem/deficiency you just described. End by bulleting out the key features of your solution that specifically address the problem/broken bullets you had in last step.

## Section 7.
- Last, sketch us your "Plan for development" for your project. This is just a few bullet points saying how you will progress on:
    - Requirements acquisition/refinement. What is you plan for building and fleshing out requirements? Weekly client meetings? Do what? For instance, maybe each week you'll have draft of the requirements doc and/or sketches of the process data flow, the data model, whatever -- and then you'll go over that and try to refine it iteratively? What is you PLAN? Just random conversations isn't going to be very effective.
    - Technical Investigation. What are the main technical challenges or "puzzle pieces" that you'll need to design/address to do the project (e.g. RESTful API, reactive web-base front end, doing < x > on an Android platform, etc. This list will vary based on project. It's up to the team to identify what the key technical challenges and design decisions they'll need to resolve to get this done. You should boil this down to a list of 3-5 broad elements that you bullet out and intro for us. For each one, what is your PLAN for investigating and analysing choices? This is essentially the outline for your Feasibility Study, which is the next milestone!
    - Other issues. You might have issues that you will need to investigate as part of the requirements/design process. In some projects, for instance, it is critical to do an investigation on competing products to clearly see what they provide and where you can beat them. Or maybe there are legal issues to investigate and consider.
- Remember: your task here is to impress us with your insightful analysis of the problem, and confidence-inspiring plan for tackling it. This will force you to (a) really focus your initial meetings/inquiries with client; and (b) to think very carefully about what your plan/tasks are in the next months.

## Section 8.
- Closing. This is an often-botched area. You can't sell something if you just end abruptly with a whimper. Always have a conclusion slide where you summarize things briefly and create a sense of confidence and excitement about your team. So maybe "In summary, we are Team Foobar, and we are working to create a sophisticated web-based assett manager for our client, John Doe who is head of < whatever > for the < whatever > division of Company X. They have some real challenges in the area of < whatever > but we are confident that we on track to provide them with a very effective solution. Whereas before it took them < x > long and cost < y > money to do < whatever their main task is >, our solution should be able to cut this to < z > dollars and < t > time. Of course, Joe Doe and Company X aren't the only ones moving to cloud-based systems; we suspect that literally thousands of companies are facing the same problem, and < explain how your product could have broad impact/makes millions, etc >"
Note the key pieces in the above: summarize what you are doing, try to place a *value* on that for the client, and try to speculate on broader applications (if applicable).
